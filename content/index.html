                Linux is an operating system, similar to MacOS and Windows. However it's mainly used on servers and by "Linux Enthusiasts", so you won't find it natively installed on most computers. Although certain comapnies such as <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-xps-13-developer-edition/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop/ctox139w10p2c3000u" target="_blank">Dell</a> and <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=20XWCTO1WWUS3&ecpn=" target="_blank">Lenovo</a> do have a few laptop options with linux natively installed. Since it is more rare to see, most thing it's to complicated to either install or to use as a daily driver, but that's not actually the case. There are a multitude of simple Linux distrobutions that can easily be used on a daily basis.

              <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
              </br>
              <p>
                Linux is actually a kernel, invented in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. It's an open source unix-like operating system kernel, that communicates with the computers internal hardware and instructs it on what to do. After it's creation it was adopted by GNU for it's many operating systems, since it's an open source project as well. Due to it's open source nature it is constantly being changed and updated to keep up with new hardware as well as newer more complex programming needs. In essence it works fairly similar to how MacOS and Windows work with the main difference being that it's open source so everyone can contribute to the project. This also leads to it being used in a wide variety of software and enterprise computing environments.

              <h3>What's a Distrobution?</h3>
              </br>
              <p>
                 The distobution is the interface that will run the computer on the users end. Each distrobution will give you the option to either use a desktop environment or a tiling window manager. Without diving down the rabbit hole completely, DE's and WM's are what you'll interact with to organize and manage all of the applications you're using on your computer. Everyone has their favorite distrobution, mine is Arch linux; every distrobution is similar but unique in its own way. The major difference you'll see are the package managers, and the branch that they come from. To sum up, a distrobution is the user interface you use on top of the linux kernel.
